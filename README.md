# Shopping Cart Project

This project is part of the Odin Project's Curriculum React Course. The main goal of this project was to practice using routers and testing frameworks by building a mock shopping cart.

A simple React application for building and previewing a Curriculum Vitae (CV).

# Description

This project is a React-based shopping cart application that allows users to browse products, add them to the cart, and proceed to checkout. The app includes multiple pages such as the home page, shop page, and cart page. The shop page displays a list of products with individual cards, quantity controls, and "Add To Cart" functionality. The cart page shows a summary of items in the cart, allowing users to review, update quantities, and proceed to checkout. The checkout page doesn't implement the logic to actually place order and pay, instead the button resets the cart to empty.
This project was built as part of the Odin Project's React curriculum.
